# prog-lang-classifier

## My approach

1. Look into data
2. Prepare simple and easy weak classifier for given problem
3. prepare little framework/scripts to train and eval weak classifier - keep code generic in order to change classifier impl
4. calculate metrics, train test set split, make it all generic, in order to do it for many different models
5. implement more advanced models
6. compare advanced and simple one models
7. fine tune hyper-parameters of more advanced models with experiments
8. run experiments for whole night to find best hyper-parameters
9. evaluate models
